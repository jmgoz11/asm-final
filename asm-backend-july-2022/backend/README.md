# Backend

A mandala of microservices.

These would each be in their own repo, aside from the `registrations-bff`.

## Registrations BFF

The _backend for frontend_ for the `registrations-web` Angular project.

This API is owned by the team that creates the Angular frontend.

## Courses API

This is a **reference** API. It is **immutable**.

## Offerings API

This is a **reference** API. It is **mutable** and so each entity has a revision number.
